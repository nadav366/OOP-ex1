=          Design           =
=============================
The purpose of the software was to start experimenting with object oriented programming by working according
 to the API.
The software simulates a library, and includes three objects - a book, parton, and a library and simple
 interfaces between them.

=  Implementation details   =
=============================
To make sure that each user does not lend more books than is permitted, I have created another set that keeps
 the number of books lent to each user.
Although this requires more memory, but I did not want, in terms of efficiency, to go through all the books on
 the lending of the book, so I chose to do so.
